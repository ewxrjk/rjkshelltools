        * adverbio.c: -O FD:PATH where the open(PATH, ...) returned a value
          matching FD would unhelpfuly close FD.  Problem reported by Colin
          Watson.

        * with-lock.c: bogus string literal
2003-07-19 17:35:12  Richard Kettlewell  <rjk@greenend.org.uk>

        * check-tested-everything, test-*: check that every executable has
          been tested
        
        * configure.ac: quieten autoconf
        
        * debug.c, utils.h, run-repeatedly.c: new debugging interface
        
        * test-run-repeatedly: fix test
        
2003-07-19 11:26:29  Richard Kettlewell  <rjk@greenend.org.uk>

        * prepare: don't configure if asked not to
        
        * test-run-repeatedly: tests
        
2003-03-08  Richard Kettlewell  <rjk@greenend.org.uk>

	* inplace.1: added some examples
	
2002-11-28  Richard Kettlewell  <rjk@greenend.org.uk>

	* iobuffer.c: use a single big circular buffer rather than lots of
	small buffers.  This makes more predictable and efficient use of
	memory than the previous strategy.

	Also change --max-buffer/-m to --buffer/-b since it is now the
	exact buffer size.

2002-11-23  Richard Kettlewell  <rjk@greenend.org.uk>

	* More test infrastructure.  Various tests improved.

	* run-repeatedly.c: underscore in filenames is allowed (to match
	run-parts)

2002-11-22  Richard Kettlewell  <rjk@greenend.org.uk>

	* various changes to build on FreeBSD.  daemon (at least) doesn't
	seem to work properly there though.

2002-11-21  Richard Kettlewell  <rjk@greenend.org.uk>

	* alarm.c: report failed setpgid correctly

	* lots of <syscall>_e functions to keep error handling out of the
	main code.  Convert a couple of malloc/realloc calls to the x-
	versions too (for the same reason).

	* more tests

2002-11-20  Richard Kettlewell  <rjk@greenend.org.uk>

	* test-daemon: more tests, including for some of the new features

	* logfds.c: adjust option letters so daemon & logfds are
	consistent.

	* daemon.c: saner error output handling - essentially build part
	of logfds into daemon.

2002-11-18  Richard Kettlewell  <rjk@greenend.org.uk>

	* anagrams.c: use dynamic memory allocation rather than fixed-size
	buffers.  Now there should be no size limits other than available
	memory.

	Also, now you can specify multiple word lists, and duplicate words
	don't cause duplicate anagrams.

2002-11-17  Richard Kettlewell  <rjk@greenend.org.uk>

	* new programs: iobuffer, anagrams

2002-11-11  Richard Kettlewell  <rjk@greenend.org.uk>

	* inplace.c: fix message reported when a subprocess gets a signal

	* alarm: new --verbose option

	* new programs: logfds, bind/accept/connect-socket, pidfile,
	run-as, daemon, run-repeatedly, with-lock

	* switch to new autoconf &c

2001-09-09  Richard Kettlewell  <rjk@greenend.org.uk>

	* configure.in: changed version to 0.6.0

	* added "daemon" program.

2001-08-12  Richard Kettlewell  <rjk@greenend.org.uk>

	* merged "inplace" and "adverbio" into a single package
