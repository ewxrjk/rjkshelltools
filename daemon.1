.TH daemon 1
.SH NAME
daemon \- run a process as a daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B daemon
.RI [ options ]
.RB [ -- ]
.IR command ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdaemon\fR runs \fIcommand\fR as a daemon.  It performs the
following steps:
.TP
.B .
All file descriptors above 2 are closed (unless \fB--no-close\fR was
specified)
.TP
.B .
The process switches to the root directory (unless \fB--no-chdir\fR
was specified).
.TP
.B .
If the \fB-l\fR or \fB-L\fR options were used, then a daemon is
created to handle the logging.  If \fB-l\fR was used then any further
errors will go to the logfile.
.TP
.B .
The process forks.  The parent waits for the child to terminate and
then exits (normally this happens almost immediately).
.TP
.B .
In the child, the remaining file descriptors (0, 1 and 2) are
redirected to \fB/dev/null\fR unless the appropriate \fB-l\fR/\fB-L\fR
option or \fB--no-close\fR was used.
.IP
If you didn't specify \fB-l\fR or \fB--no-close\fR then any errors
from here on will not be reported anywhere.
.TP
.B .
The process calls \fBsetsid\fR(2) to create a new session.
.TP
.B .
The process forks again, so that it isn't the session leader.  The
parent exits immediately.
.TP
.B .
In the child, the command is executed.
