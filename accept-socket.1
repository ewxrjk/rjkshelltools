.SH SYNOPSIS
.B accept-socket
.RI [ options ]
.RB [ -- ]
.I lfd
.I cfd
.RB [ -- ]
.IR command ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBaccept-socket\fR listens on a socket with file descriptor \fIlfd\fR
and accepts connections.  When one arrives it executes \fIcommand\fR
in a child process, with file descriptor \fIcfd\fR redirected to the
new connection.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-v\fR, \fB--verbose\fR
Verbose mode.  Reports errors that would normally be silently ignored,
and generates a line describing the origin of each new connection.
.TP
\fB-c\fR, \fB--no-close\fR
Prevents \fIlfd\fR from being closed.  Normally it is closed before
the command is executed.  If \fIlfd\fR and \fIcfd\fR are the same then
this option has no useful effect.
.TP
\fB-n\fR, \fB--numeric\fR
Don't do a DNS lookup for remote hostnames on incoming inet connections.
.TP
\fB-h\fR, \fB--help\fR
